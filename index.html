			<p class="text1"> <span>Geralt of Rivia</span> was a witcher, Ciri's adoptive father, and despite their tumultuous relationship, loved the sorceress Yennefer, who was considered the love of his life.</p>

            <p class="text1">During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.</p>

            <p class="text1">Despite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with the witchers by his mother, Visenna, he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen. </p>
            <p class="text1">
            As his first choice, Geralt chose "Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so "Geralt" was all that remained of his chosen name. "Of Rivia" was a more practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more authentic.</p>

			<p class="text1"> <span>Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon</span> (better known as Ciri), was born in 1253,[3] and most likely during the Belleteyn holiday.[4] She was the sole princess of Cintra, the daughter of Pavetta and Emhyr var Emreis (who was using the alias "Duny" at the time) as well as Queen Calanthe's granddaughter.</p>

            <p class="text1">After Geralt of Rivia helped lift Duny's curse, Duny asked what reward the witcher would like and Geralt proclaimed the Law of Surprise, as it turned out Pavetta was pregnant with Ciri, unbeknownst to Duny.<p>

            <p class="text1">Ciri was born in Skellige in Belleteyn of the following year[5] and initially, Calanthe ordered her advisor Mousesack to kill Geralt,[6] wishing to break free from the Law of Surprise. [7]</p>
            <p class="text1">
           Growing up, not much is known about Ciri's relationship with her parents, thought it appeared Pavetta adored her daughter, with others remarking how it was rare for her to be parted from Ciri.</p>

			<p class="text1"> <span>Yennefer</span>, born on Belleteyn in 1173,[3] was a sorceress who lived in Vengerberg, the capital city of Aedirn. She was Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, whom she viewed like a daughter to the point that she did everything she could to rescue the girl and keep her from harm.</p>

            <p class="text1">She helped advise King Demavend of Aedirn (though was never a formal royal advisor), a close friend of Triss Merigold, and the youngest member of the Supreme Council of Sorcerers within the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. <p>

            <p class="text1">Born in 1173, Yennefer had a rough childhood from the moment she was born, having been born a hunchback. Her father immediately detested her due to this deformity and blamed Yennefer's mother for it, claiming it was through her side, with mages and elven blood, not to mention her having had an abortion before, that caused the deformity.Her mother initially tried to protect Yennefer, believing it was by the will of the gods.</p>
