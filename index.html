			<p class="text1"> Geralt of Rivia was a witcher, Ciri's adoptive father, and despite their tumultuous relationship, loved the sorceress Yennefer, who was considered the love of his life.</p>

            <p class="text1">During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.

            <p class="text1">Despite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with the witchers by his mother, Visenna, he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen. In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir.</p>
